I felt scared of the monkeys living at our flat because Saurab said they might jump on us!

I felt very happy and excited when we went on the boat trip on the river Ganges.

We saw the cremation grounds from the boat. I could see dead people on the fire. I felt sad for the people that loved them.

Only men are allowed to go to the fires. The fires have been burning for thousands of years and the fire has never gone out.

They sing a song to the river every night because they think it's a god.

I put candles on the water and made a wish.
