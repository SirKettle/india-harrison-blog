I felt shy and worried to meet Sandeep.

The slum was full of flies. The houses were made of rubbish and junk.

Life is hard for Sandeep; they can't afford food or water because they don't have that much money.

His father has to clear out rats and mice out of the slums for his job.

Sandeep loved his lego, at the end he was so excited when he finished it.

We brought them some food and clothes, they gave us flower necklaces.

I'm happy I met Sandeep because he was cute and funny.
