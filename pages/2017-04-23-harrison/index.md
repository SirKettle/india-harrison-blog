We got picked up from the station early and came to **The Farm**, our new home in Jaipur.

_A really wide load._

It's made from wood and bits and bobs, bottles, artistic things and fake spiders.

Our bedroom is really big, there are motorbikes and lorries everywhere.

The shower curtain is made of bubble wrap.

The swimming pool is cold and deep, but I enjoyed it.

_There are lots of lego vehicles next to the pool to play with!_

The food was the best. They made loads of chapatis!
