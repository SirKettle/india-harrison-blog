We got up early on the train. I drank Mummy's chai while she was asleep.

We got off the train and went in a jeep into the desert. It was colder than the city!

We saw tumble weed.

We got no tent, instead we slept under the stars.

We saw loads of Dung beetles.

I saw loads of skeletons and bones. I found big horns - 2 of them.
