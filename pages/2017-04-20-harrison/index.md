We woke up very early on the exciting sleeper train.

We arrived at Udaipur. It was very big.

We took a tuk-tuk to the hotel.

### The Udai Kothi - our hotel.

It was shiny and glittery with sparkles. It was made of marble.

It was very pretty and exciting. The pool was on the rooftop!

We went in the swimming pool again and again.

We had an amazing lunch. We went in the swimming pool again!

We had a super dinner and went to bed.

### A boat trip on the lake.

Okay oops, I forgot, we went on a boat on the lake. It was very windy and wavey.
